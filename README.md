# SaintLock By Jai.S

For my term 2 assessment tasks I have been tasked of developing a Python and Gooey-Pie application to protect
your personal information from hackers in this ever-changing technological world as data breaches has become 
an ever-increasing problem. In 2022 alone 3 billion passwords were stolen and breached. With this app my aim 
is that your password will take centuries to get breached and your precious personal data will be safe, additionally 
my aim is to have coded a bug free working application that users can use anytime to protect themselves online. 
The construction of SaintLock is as follows:  

I defined lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits and symbols in lists with a simple text box. 

Next, I set a points system. If any of the defining characters in each defined list are in the text box, points will be added.  

With extra variables of password length and the time it takes to crack the password I added points up to 100 

and ratings to match the points. 

If your password doesn't meet the perfect 10/10 ranking, feedback will be given to improve your password.  

If you don't want to write a password, a password generator is added to give you a 10/10 ranked password  

which you can copy to your clipboard at any time.  

To install my app please use the GitHub Repository - https://github.com/JaiStrbik/password_checker 

Thanks for using my app and make sure to always keep your personal information safe and to remember SaintLock can fortify your privacy fortress!
